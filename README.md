BrainStation<>Earnest & Young collaborative Hackathon - providing solution for SMB (Small-Medium Business) during COVIC-19 crisis


1. Brainstorming

We discussed on what kind of problems we, as consumers, and business owners are facing. From there, we came up with few different solutions.

Problems;
 - Old people have concerns or unable to go out to shop for groceries or drugs (maybe volunteer portal)
 - Owners concerns of employer health and saftey (espcially if they are front line and exposed to customers)
 - corner stores has no online presence, large selection of proudcts and no tech knowhow to use something like shopify
 - cannot try on clothings or don't know how it will look on you (i.e. cosmetic)
 - subscription style service and products -- small retail stores
 - curate your own stores (personalized market place)
 - small stores has no online presence or has difficulty 
 - price transparency and competition for retailers
 - no shop clerks to help you shop or answer your questions
 - product search by images
 - too many tabs to go through when shopping online; have things in mind will prefer to go straight to the product
 - online service for personal trainer and other health services / online health tracker


2. Decision

We decided to focus on SMB groceries and their local suppliers, as their supply chain can be very spread out and vulnerable to disruption (like a pandemic); they might not have access to all suppliers due to fragmantation. It will be beneficial if they can consolidate all their offerings and one-stop shop for SMB grocers to check available local supplies.

5. Web Development

 - Within the short amount of time, my partner and I tried to mock the design as much as possible. The routes works perfectly fine, and hover effects provide more insights.

What we could have done in the given time;
